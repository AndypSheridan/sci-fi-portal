## Overview

I used the Github's [project board](https://github.com/users/AndypSheridan/projects/2) to create and track issues and User Stories.

This proved instrumental in keeping me focused on tasks and creating the necessary features for the project. As this was my first solo experience of using Github projects, I found that on several occasions I underestimated or overstimated the amount of time and/or tasks for each particular sprint but, on the whole, the schedule worked well.

See below for a summary of the various iterations.

### Sprint 1

* February 18-19 2023

The purpose of this short sprint was to create a functioning Django app and immediately deploy it to Heroku with the initial libraries I intended to use. The first deployment failed due to a typo in the settings.py file but this was corrected and the app deployed as expected.

### Sprint 2

* February 19-23 2023

This sprint was slightly longer and focused on creating the ERD using DrawSQL, then realising these in models.py. Once this step was done, I developed the structure for the home page view, template and url. I then created the admin area in admin.py. Whilst I achieved all of this ahead of schedule, it became clear that this was a steep learning process and that my planning could have been more thorough. I resolved to take more time outlining my next sprint.

### Sprint 3

* February 24-28 2023

Sprint 3 involved developing views, templates and urls for the main pages of the site. This is when the project board became an invaluable reference point. There were two occasions when the project as a whole seemed quite overwhelming but the project board helped to keep me focused. I did find that I had not been specific enough with some user stories so I edited these and added several more as I became more familiar with the process. This sprint finished ahead of schedule on the 27th.

### Sprint 4

* March 1-5 2023

Sprint 4 took slightly longer than expected. The purpose of this was to add all background images and provide the User with a front end method to upload book photographs. Due to some image size and resolution issues, plus a lack of familiarity with the Cloudinary platform, it took longer than expected to achieve, so I finished this sprint on the 7th March.

### Sprint 5

* March 7-14 2023

I allowed a week for sprint 5. The purpose was to add all site content, navigation and ensure CRUD functionality worked in all instances where the admin or user needed it.
