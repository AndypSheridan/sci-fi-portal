## **Testing Overview**

At the time of writing this is the largest project I had undertaken so I felt the testing process needed to be as thorough as possible. The Sci-Portal was tested on a variety of devices including a MacBook Pro 2021, a MacBook Air 2020, an iPad Air 2020, iPhone 12, iPhone SE, Dell Desktop with 24" Screen, Kindle Fire and a Samsung Galaxy Tablet.

The majority of User testing was conducted by myself, however I enlisted the help of family and several work colleagues, essentially to try to break the site or help me identify bugs and areas for improvement.

All buttons and links were clicked multiple times to test they functioned as expected. Multiple test reviews were created, edited and deleted to check the efficacy of the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality across the site.

Inevitably there were bugs and these are outlined and summarised below.

Full details of manual testing can be found on this page.

<hr>

## **Bugs**
‚Äã
The following bugs were identified during user testing:

* Bug üêû - When running the search function, it would display results from books which had not yet been published and therefore resulted in an error.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - Whilst the search function worked as intended, I had not set a specific condition for which results could be displayed.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Added an if statement that would only display results if the Book status was set to published.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Logging in would redirect the User to the Books page.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - This was what I had set the login redirect to do during the initial stages of the project before the inception of the Search Function.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Adjust login redirect in settings.py

‚Äã<br>

* Bug üêû - An error message was displayed when submitting the 'add book' form after setting the 'created_by' field to hidden.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - The field was removed so that Users could not submit reviews as other Users. This meant the field, which is required, would be empty and thus result in the error and the form failing to submit.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Used some simple JavaScript code to pre-populate the 'created_by' field with the logged-in User id.

<br>

* Bug üêû - The front end method for Users to add Book or Profile images did not work.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - Lack of familiarity with, and knowledge of the Cloudinary platform.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Researched the various methods to upload and save images to Cloudinary and add Cloudinary fields to forms.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Error messages displayed after creating the UserProfile class.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - As the UserProfile class was added after several Users had already been created, no profiles were linked to their accounts.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Used the Admin page to assign profiles to Users by using the drop-down menu.

<br>

* Bug üêû - When setting debug=False in settings.py, and removing DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from Heroku Config Vars, project would not deploy.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - Heroku failed to collect static files due to a conflict between Whitenoise and Cloudinary.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Removed Whitenoise and ran the deployment again.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Initial deployment of Django app failed.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - There was a typo in the settings.py file.
* ‚úÖ - Corrected typo.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Users were unable to register without providing a valid email address, something I did not deem necessary for this project.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - Email was set to required in settings.py.
* ‚úÖ - Adjusted the settings to remove the need for an email address. The User can still choose to provide one if they wish.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Lighthouse scores for some pages were poor.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - There were several reasons for reduced performance but the main one seemed to eminate from an issue with jQuery.
* ‚úÖ - Removed jQuery from the app.


<hr>

## **Unfixed Bugs**

* At this stage, there are no known unfixed bugs.

<hr>

## Lighthouse**

The Lighthouse test results for all major pages can be found below. The Mobile scores are generally lower in terms of performance with the reason being some issues with the Bootstrap CDN and the images used. The majority of these images were already compressed to what I felt was an acceptable limit. Some of the lower scores are as a result of the Cloudinary integration and issues with cookies which I feel were beyond my control here.

### Home Page

![Books page mobile lighthouse](docs/validation/books-lighthouse-mobile.png)

### Authors Page

*Desktop*

![Authors page desktop lighthouse](docs/validation/authors-lighthouse.png)

The lower 'best practice' score is as a result of the following which is a cookie issue related to Cloudinary:

### Book Detail Page

The reasons for the reduced 'best practices' score can be seen below:

![Book detail best practice lighthouse](docs/validation/book-detail-lighthouse-bp.png)

In the above instance, the image proportions are as intended and I found no lack of clarity during testing.

![Book detail best practice lighthouse 2](docs/validation/book-detail-lighthouse-bp-2.png)

The above instance again flags issue to do with cookies and Cloudinary which I felt were beyond my control given the time constraints. They do not affect the performance or appearance of the page.

## **Validation**

### **HTML**

The code for all pages was run through the [W3C HTML Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). Ultimately several pages needed to be entered as text due to the User Authentication features used across the site. This meant having to remove the Jinja templating language as it resulted in errors in any instance where it was still present in the code.

Results from the validation can be seen below:

#### ***Home Page***

![Home page HTML validation](docs/validation/sfportal-home-html-validation.png)

#### ***Books Page***

#### ***Authors Page***

<hr>

### ***CSS***

The custom CSS code was passed through the [W3C Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The result can be seen below:

![CSS Validation Result](docs/validation/sfp-css-certificate.png)


<hr>

### ***JavaScript***

Although there is very little JavaScript in this code, I ran it through the [JSHint Validation Service](https://jshint.com/). The result can be seen below:

![JS Validation Result](docs/validation/sfp-js-validation.png)


<hr>

### ***Python / Django ***

The PEP8 Online Validator was down when creating this project, however I added a PEP8 validator to my workspace by running the command: "pip3 install pycodestyle". The validator identified the errors in the following files:

![PycodeStyle Results views.py](docs/validation/views-py-errors.png)


This highlights an error in line length which I was unable to rectify without breaking the code. I decided against changing it.

![PycodeStyle Results settings.py](docs/validation/settings-py-errors.png)


Again there are issues with line length but I was reluctant to change anything in this file. I surmised that as this was the default code, it was better to leave it in place.

![PycodeStyle Results env.py](docs/validation/env-py-errors.png)

The final errors displayed also related line length. I was unsure how to remedy this without compromising the code in the env.py file so overlooked this too.
